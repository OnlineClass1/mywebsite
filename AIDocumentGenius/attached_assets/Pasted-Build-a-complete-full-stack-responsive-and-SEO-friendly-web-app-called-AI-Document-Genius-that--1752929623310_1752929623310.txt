Build a complete, full-stack, responsive, and SEO-friendly web app called “AI Document Genius” that includes the following features:

🎯 Core Features:
Upload support for PDF, PPT, DOCX, and TXT files

No file size or page limit

File upload via drag & drop or file picker

Disable interaction tabs (Summary, Q&A, Humanize) until file is uploaded

After upload:

Enable and show three distinct modes:

Summarization

Q&A

Humanize Text

Each mode must:

Use AI (Gemini or OpenAI via backend only)

Generate output in readable, well-structured format using:

Proper headings (<h1>, <h2>), paragraphs (<p>), bullet points (<ul>), numbered lists (<ol>)

Avoid long raw text blocks; the result must look like human-written blog text or notes

Be optimized for SEO

For Q&A: include page number reference, and explain clearly in human tone (not technical)

After each result is processed, show:

✅ Download button (to export .txt)

✅ Copy to Clipboard button

🔐 Security & Backend (Important):
All AI interactions (summarization, Q&A, humanizing) must go through the backend only

Do NOT expose API keys in frontend

Use Node.js (Express) or Python Flask for backend

Store API keys in .env file

Support Gemini-pro or OpenAI GPT-4 for backend processing

💡 Advanced Interface Features:
Display tabbed or toggle views for:

Summary

Q&A

Humanize

Original Preview

Highlight content sections linked to Q&A results

Only show Download and Copy buttons after output is generated (not before)

Add file processing animation / loading spinner

Show messages like:

“Smart Summary Ready!”

“Here’s your Humanized Version”

“Ask your question from the document below”

🧼 UI/UX & Visual Design:
Remove any default top download bar or clutter

Use clean, modern design:

Gradient or soft color backgrounds

Rounded cards

Glowing interactive buttons

Shadowed components

Fully responsive across mobile, tablet (iPhone, iPad), and desktop

Support light/dark mode toggle

📈 SEO Optimization:
Use semantic HTML structure:

Use <h1>, <h2>, <ul>, <ol>, <p>, etc.
